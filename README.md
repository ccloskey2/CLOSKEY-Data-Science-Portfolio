# Data Science Portfolio

## About this Portfolio
- *Purpose*: The purpose of this portfolio is to organize and display all the data science projects I will work on throughout my semester in Introduction to Data Science (Spring 2025). These projects will include applications of exploratory data analysis, data visualization, predictive modeling, and machine learning. 


## Projects
- **Data Visualization**
   - *Description*: These projects include both visualizations of datasets for display purporses as well as interactive datasets. Take a look in the basic     streamlit app folder to see some of the data visualization interactive dataframe projects using Streamlit I am currently working on.
